Welcome to the AI powered coaching app that is meant to help users keep up with their goals. The app is divided into the front end and back end so it is important to navigate to the directories for both and have them run.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Run the back end:
'uvicorn main:app --reload'
