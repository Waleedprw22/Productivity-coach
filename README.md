Welcome to the AI powered coaching app that is meant to help users keep up with their goals. The app is divided into the front end and back end so it is important to navigate to the directories for both and have them run. After developing the functionalities of this bot, we then integrated it into a larger app found at the following repo: https://github.com/adam-gill/accountability. The larger app is meant to enhance productivity by havng friends and family compete with one another by logging their hours dedicated to productivity.
